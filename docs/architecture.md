## **Design Philosophy**

### **Scalability**

- Folder structure separates **global components** from **page-specific components**, making it easy to maintain and extend.

### **Reusability**

- Common elements like `Navbar` and `Footer` are kept in `components/` to ensure they're reusable throughout the site.

### **Data-Driven Design**

- Static data (e.g., `projects.json`, `news.json`) is stored in the `data/` folder to decouple logic and UI.

### **Type Safety**

- TypeScript is used extensively to minimize runtime errors and improve developer experience.

## **Development Workflow**

1. **Add New Pages:**

   - Add a new folder under `app/` and create a `page.tsx` file.

2. **Add New Components:**

   - Create a new `.tsx` file under `components/`.
   - If it’s page-specific, place it under a subfolder (e.g., `components/Homepage`).

3. **Add New Data:**
   - Update or add a new JSON file in the `data/` folder.
   - Use TypeScript definitions from `types/` for validation.
