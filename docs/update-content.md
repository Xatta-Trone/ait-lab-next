## **Updating Existing Data**

### General Steps

1. Open the relevant JSON file in the `data/` directory.
2. Locate the item you want to update.
3. Modify the required fields. For example:
   - Update the `status` of a project:
     ```json
     "status": "completed"
     ```
   - Change a team member's role:
     ```json
     "label": "Ph.D. Student"
     ```
4. Save the file.

## **Deleting Existing Data**

### General Steps

1. Open the relevant JSON file in the `data/` directory.
2. Locate the object you want to delete.
3. Remove the object, ensuring you don't leave trailing commas in the JSON array.
   - Example:
     ```json
     [
       {
         "title": "Course 1"
       },
       {
         "title": "Course 2"
       }
     ]
     ```
     If you delete "Course 1", the result should look like:
     ```json
     [
       {
         "title": "Course 2"
       }
     ]
     ```
4. Save the file.

## **Best Practices**

1. **Validation**:
   - Use a JSON linter or IDE extensions to validate the JSON format after editing.
   - Ensure there are no duplicate entries.
2. **Image Uploads**:
   - Add any new images referenced in the data to the `public/img/` directory.
3. **Testing**:
   - Test the changes locally by running the development server (`yarn dev` or `npm run dev`) to ensure the updates reflect correctly.
4. **Version Control**:
   - Commit the changes to the version control system (e.g., Git) with a meaningful message like:
     ```
     git add data/projects.json
     git commit -m "Added AI in Traffic Systems project"
     git push
     ```

## **Adding New Data Types**

If you need to manage a new type of data:

1. **Create a New JSON File**:
   - Example: `data/awards.json`.
2. **Define the Structure**:
   - Create a sample structure:
     ```json
     [
       {
         "title": "Best AI Lab 2024",
         "organization": "Tech Awards",
         "year": 2024,
         "description": "Awarded for excellence in AI research."
       }
     ]
     ```
3. **Integrate the New Data**:
   - Update the relevant components in `components/` or create new ones to display this data.
4. **Test the Integration**:
   - Test the feature locally to ensure it works as expected.
