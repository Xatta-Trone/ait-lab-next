abstract: "Tabular data, widely used in industries like healthcare, finance, and transportation, presents unique challenges for deep learning due to its heterogeneous nature and lack of spatial structure. This survey reviews the evolution of deep learning models for tabular data, from early fully connected networks (FCNs) to advanced architectures like TabNet, SAINT, TabTranSELU, and MambaNet. These models incorporate attention mechanisms, feature embeddings, and hybrid architectures to address tabular data complexities. TabNet uses sequential attention for instance-wise feature selection, improving interpretability, while SAINT combines self-attention and intersample attention to capture complex interactions across features and data points, both advancing scalability and reducing computational overhead. Hybrid architectures such as TabTransformer and FT-Transformer integrate attention mechanisms with multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) to handle categorical and numerical data, with FT-Transformer adapting transformers for tabular datasets. Research continues to balance performance and efficiency for large datasets. Graph-based models like GNN4TDL and GANDALF combine neural networks with decision trees or graph structures, enhancing feature representation and mitigating overfitting in small datasets through advanced regularization techniques.

## Deep Tabular Learning Evolution

Tabular data, characterized by its heterogeneous nature and lack of spatial structure, presents unique challenges for deep learning applications. Unlike image or text data, tabular data consists of mixed data types (numerical, categorical, ordinal) without inherent spatial or sequential relationships, making traditional deep learning architectures less effective.

This survey traces the evolution of deep learning models for tabular data, from early fully connected networks (FCNs) to sophisticated architectures that incorporate attention mechanisms, feature embeddings, and hybrid approaches. The field has witnessed significant advancements in addressing the fundamental challenges of tabular data representation and learning.
