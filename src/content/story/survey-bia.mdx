## Bio-Inspired Algorithm Taxonomy

Bio-Inspired Algorithms (BIAs) represent a class of metaheuristic methods inspired by biological and natural processes, designed to solve complex, nonlinear, high-dimensional optimization problems. These algorithms emulate strategies from evolution, swarm behavior, foraging, and immune response systems, offering robust and flexible problem-solving mechanisms.

The fundamental strength of BIAs lies in their ability to traverse vast and complex search spaces efficiently through stochastic, population-based, and adaptive approaches. Unlike classical optimization methods that require gradient information and struggle with local optima, BIAs maintain solution diversity through mechanisms such as mutation, self-organization, and decentralized coordination.
