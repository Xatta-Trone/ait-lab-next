# AIT Lab Demonstrates Strong Research Leadership at TRB Annual Meeting 2026 in Washington, D.C.

The Artificial Intelligence in Transportation (AIT) Lab at Texas State University made a significant impact at the **105th Transportation Research Board Annual Meeting (TRBAM 2026)**, held in Washington, D.C., presenting **more than 40 peer-reviewed research papers** across technical sessions throughout the program.

The Transportation Research Board Annual Meeting is among the world’s premier transportation research conferences, attracting over 10,000 researchers, practitioners, policymakers, and industry leaders each year. The AIT Lab’s extensive participation highlights its growing national and international presence in applying artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data-driven methodologies to transportation safety and mobility challenges.

## A Strong Delegation of Faculty and Student Researchers

The AIT Lab delegation was led by **Dr. Subasish Das**, Director of the AIT Lab, and included the following student researchers:

* **Dr. Subasish Das** (Director)
* **Shriyank Somvanshi**
* **Sawgat Ahmed Shuvo**
* **Md Monzurul Islam**
* **Tausif Islam Chowdhury**
* **Gaurab Chhetri**
* **Biplov Pandey**

Together, the team contributed presentations covering a wide range of topics, including crash severity modeling, autonomous vehicle safety, explainable artificial intelligence, pedestrian and micromobility risk analysis, urban mobility analytics, and social media–based transportation perception studies.

## Advancing Transportation Safety Through AI

Across oral and poster sessions, AIT Lab researchers showcased work leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning, deep learning, and explainable AI frameworks to analyze large-scale transportation datasets. These studies aim to improve injury severity prediction, enhance infrastructure safety assessment, and better understand public perceptions of emerging mobility technologies.

Dr. Das emphasized the importance of student-centered research engagement:

> *TRB provides an exceptional platform for interdisciplinary collaboration and knowledge exchange. I am proud of our students and researchers for their dedication and the breadth of work they presented. Their contributions demonstrate how computational approaches can directly inform transportation policy and safety practice.*

A key highlight of this year’s participation was the strong involvement of student researchers, including undergraduate contributors, who actively presented their work, attended committee meetings, and engaged with experts from academia, government agencies, and industry. For many, TRBAM 2026 marked their first international research conference, offering valuable professional exposure and networking opportunities.

## Building the Future of Transportation Research

The AIT Lab’s presence at TRBAM 2026 underscores Texas State University’s expanding role in transportation-focused artificial intelligence research. Through continued collaboration with academic partners, transportation agencies, and industry stakeholders, the lab remains committed to developing data-driven solutions that advance roadway safety, support equitable mobility, and foster resilient transportation systems.
