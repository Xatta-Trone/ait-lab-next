            "description": "The objective of this project was to investigate the impact of intersection corner radius on pedestrian crashes and right-turn vehicle speeds. The study aimed to identify key factors influencing pedestrian crashes at specific corners, such as pedestrian and vehicle volumes, corner radius, and road configurations, and to develop a crash modification factor (CMF) for corner radius. Additionally, the project analyzed right-turn speeds, developing models that predict speeds based on corner radius and other influencing variables. The findings provide insights for improving intersection design and updating design manuals.",
